# Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning
 Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning with the help of  Long short term memory(LSTM).In this project Pandas and NumPy has been used to read and implement the data. Using machine learning LSTM prediction the test data set has been compared to the train data to see the accuracy of our prediction through a plot in Matplotlib.
